# timeoutJS

Working on a web project I realized there wasn't an easy way to simply handle timeouts on a web page after a period of inactivity. After writing some basic code to handle this, I realized it would be much cleaner to wrap everything in some basic functions to handle interacting with the timer, and that's how timeoutJS was born.
